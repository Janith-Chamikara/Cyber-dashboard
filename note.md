### ðŸŽ¯ Imagine a Library Database:

---

### âœ… 1. **External Schema (User View)** â€“ What the user sees

* **Example:**

  * A **student** using the library system only sees:

    * Book Title
    * Author
    * Availability

* **Why?**
  The student doesnâ€™t need to see how the books are stored or who last borrowed them.

---

### âœ… 2. **Conceptual Schema (Logical Structure)** â€“ What the database stores logically

* **Example:**

  * The database has tables like:

    * `Books (BookID, Title, Author, ISBN, Publisher, Year)`
    * `Members (MemberID, Name, Email)`
    * `Loans (LoanID, BookID, MemberID, LoanDate, ReturnDate)`

* **Why?**
  This shows the **whole structure** of the database and how data is related, but not how it's stored physically.

---

### âœ… 3. **Internal Schema (Physical Storage)** â€“ How it's stored in memory

* **Example:**

  * The `Books` table is stored in a file on disk.
  * Thereâ€™s an **index** on the `BookID` to make search faster.
  * Data might be **compressed** or split into different blocks on disk.

* **Why?**
  This level deals with how to **store and access data efficiently**.

### ðŸ§  In short:

| Level          | What it shows            | Example from Library System                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **External**   | Userâ€™s view              | Student sees book title, author, availability |
| **Conceptual** | Logical design           | Tables: Books, Members, Loans + relationships |
| **Internal**   | Physical storage details | Files, indexes, storage blocks, compression   |
